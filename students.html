I need to create a webpage for my research group. I was told that github is a good option for that
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
GitHub is an excellent platform for hosting a research group webpage, as it allows you to easily create, manage, and deploy a website for free using GitHub Pages. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a professional and visually appealing webpage for your research group:

1. Set Up a GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one.
Create a new repository with the name <username>.github.io (replace <username> with your GitHub username). This will host your site.
Set the repository to public and check "Add a README file."
2. Choose a Template
There are three main ways to create a webpage:

Use a Static Site Generator: Tools like Jekyll (default for GitHub Pages), Hugo, or Gatsby allow you to build dynamic static sites.
Use a Ready-Made Theme: Browse Jekyll Themes or GitHub Pages Templates.
Build From Scratch: If you know HTML/CSS, you can design your webpage manually.
3. Clone and Set Up Locally
Clone your repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git
Add your chosen theme or template files to the repository.
If using Jekyll:
Install Ruby and Jekyll locally.
Run jekyll serve to preview your site.
4. Add Content
Update or create the following files:

index.html: The homepage. Include your research group's name, description, and main links.
Subpages: Create separate .html or .md files for:
Projects
Publications
Team Members
Contact Information
Outreach or Public Engagement (if relevant)
Customisation: Edit CSS and assets (images, logos) to personalise the look.
5. Push Your Changes
Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website setup"
git push origin main
Your site should now be live at https://<username>.github.io.
6. Custom Domain (Optional)
To use a custom domain (e.g., ml-health-group.com):

Purchase a domain from a provider (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains).
Add a CNAME file to your repository with the domain name.
Update your domain’s DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages.
7. Maintain and Update
Regularly update your repository with new content or research. You can use version control to track changes over time.

Would you like assistance selecting a theme or setting up specific content, like a "Team" or "Publications" page?







You said:
if my user name is MartaVallejo and the new repository name is ML-Health, can you give me the steps from 3?

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! If your GitHub username is MartaVallejo and your repository name is ML-Health, here’s how to proceed from Step 3 to set up your webpage:

3. Clone the Repository Locally
Open your terminal or Git Bash.
Clone your repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/MartaVallejo/ML-Health.git
Navigate to the repository folder:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ML-Health
4. Set Up GitHub Pages
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the Settings tab.
Scroll down to the Pages section in the sidebar.
Under Source, select the branch you want to use (e.g., main) and click Save.
GitHub Pages will now publish your site at: https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health.
5. Add a Template
You can either:

Download a Template:

Browse Jekyll Themes or GitHub Pages Templates.
Download the theme as a .zip file or clone the theme’s repository.
Copy the template files into your ML-Health repository folder.
Build From Scratch:

Create a new index.html file in the repository folder.
Write your homepage content in this file using HTML. For example:
html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>ML-Health</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1>
    <p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
</body>
</html>
6. Preview Locally
If using a static site generator like Jekyll:

Install Ruby and Jekyll (instructions here).
Navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
bundle exec jekyll serve
Open the local server (usually http://127.0.0.1:4000) in your browser to preview the site.
If not using Jekyll, you can preview your index.html file directly by opening it in a browser.

7. Commit and Push Your Changes
Once satisfied with your changes:

Stage all changes:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
Commit the changes with a message:
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Initial website setup"
Push the changes to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
8. Verify Your GitHub Pages Site
Go to: https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health.
Your website should now be live!
9. Add Content
Start building pages:

Create new HTML/Markdown files for each section (e.g., team.html, projects.html).
Link these files in your index.html. For example:
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="team.html">Team</a>
<a href="projects.html">Projects</a>
10. Optional: Add a Custom Domain
If you have a custom domain:

Add a CNAME file in the root of your repository with your domain name (e.g., ml-health.com).
Update your domain’s DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages (details here).
Let me know if you’d like help with setting up specific content or customising the design!







You said:
in 4.4, the only option in Source is GibHub actions. Below is the template selection.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the only option under "Source" in the GitHub Pages section is GitHub Actions, this means GitHub is encouraging the use of a workflow-based deployment rather than the classic GitHub Pages branch deployment. This requires setting up a workflow file to build and deploy your website.

Here’s how to proceed in this case:

4.4. Use GitHub Actions for Deployment
Create a Workflow File:

In your repository, navigate to the .github/workflows directory. If this folder doesn’t exist, create it.
Create a new file named github-pages.yml.
Add the Deployment Configuration: Paste the following YAML configuration into the github-pages.yml file:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Build site
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./public
          echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>ML-Health</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1><p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></html>" > ./public/index.html

      - name: Upload to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
Commit and Push:

Add, commit, and push the workflow file to your repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .github/workflows/github-pages.yml
git commit -m "Set up GitHub Actions for Pages deployment"
git push origin main
Wait for the Workflow to Run:

Go to the Actions tab in your repository to check the status of the deployment workflow.
Once completed, your site will be live at https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health.
5. Add Your Custom Content
Now that your website is deployed, you can:

Replace the placeholder index.html file with your own.
Add additional pages or assets (e.g., CSS, images) to the repository.
Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further clarification!







You said:
i press the option 'create a workflow'. Now I see a text file. The first line said "# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions". What do I need to do from here? It seems I need to save it or give it a name, perhaps, before I can leave
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You’re on the right track! Since GitHub has provided a default text file for creating a workflow, follow these steps to adapt it for deploying your webpage using GitHub Actions:

1. Name the Workflow File
At the top of the page, there should be an option to name the workflow file. Change the name to something like:
Copy
Edit
github-pages.yml
This file should automatically be saved in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository.
2. Edit the Workflow Content
Replace the default content in the text editor with the following configuration, which is tailored for deploying your GitHub Pages site:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Build static site
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./public
          echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>ML-Health</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1><p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></html>" > ./public/index.html

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
3. Save and Commit the Workflow
Once you’ve replaced the content, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
Add a commit message like:
sql
Copy
Edit
Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow
Click Commit new file.
4. Wait for the Workflow to Run
Navigate to the Actions tab in your repository.
You should see a workflow titled "Deploy GitHub Pages" running. Wait for it to complete (it may take a few minutes).
If it completes successfully, your webpage will be live at:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
5. Customise Your Website
You can now replace the placeholder index.html file with your custom content.
Add more HTML files for sections like "Projects" or "Team," and link them from the homepage.
Let me know if you need help customising your site further!







You said:
where should I add the commit message, within the "github-pages.yml" file? There is also a button called "Commit changes..."
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The commit message should not go inside the github-pages.yml file itself. Instead, you’ll add it using the Commit changes... button. Here’s what you need to do:

Steps to Add the Commit Message
After editing the github-pages.yml file, scroll to the bottom of the page.

Look for the section titled Commit changes.

In the "Commit message" field (or similar text box):

Enter a descriptive message like:
sql
Copy
Edit
Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow
Ensure the option "Commit directly to the main branch" is selected (it’s usually the default).

Click the Commit changes... button to save the workflow file to your repository.

Once you’ve committed the changes, GitHub will trigger the workflow automatically. You can monitor its progress in the Actions tab of your repository.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!







You said:
After the file, there is nothing. On the top right, there is a button called "Commit changes...", should I press it?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you should press the "Commit changes..." button on the top right. This action will save your changes to the repository and trigger the deployment workflow for your GitHub Pages site.

What Happens After You Press "Commit Changes..."
Your changes to the github-pages.yml file will be saved in the .github/workflows directory.
GitHub Actions will automatically start running the workflow.
To monitor the deployment:
Go to the Actions tab in your repository.
Look for the workflow titled Deploy GitHub Pages and check its status.
Once the workflow completes successfully, your site will be live at:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
Let me know if you need further guidance!







You said:
should I add something on "Extended description"?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The "Extended description" field is optional. You can leave it blank if you want, as it’s not necessary for the commit to work.

If you want to add more details, you could write a brief note about what the workflow does. For example:

"This workflow sets up GitHub Actions to build and deploy the ML-Health research group website using GitHub Pages."

But again, this is entirely optional. You can simply leave it empty and proceed by clicking "Commit changes...".







You said:
Commit directly or create a new branch?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You should choose "Commit directly to the main branch" in this case, as this is a straightforward setup for deploying your GitHub Pages site.

Why Commit Directly to main?
This is a simple change, and it’s part of the configuration for your live website.
Committing directly to main ensures that the workflow starts immediately, and the website deployment proceeds without needing additional steps.
When to Create a New Branch?
You might consider creating a new branch if:

You’re making large or experimental changes.
You want to review the changes before merging them into main.
Since this is just setting up the deployment workflow, commit directly to main. After selecting this option, click "Commit changes..." to proceed. Let me know if you need help after this step!







You said:
ok, this is done. What are the following steps?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Great! Now that you’ve committed the workflow, here’s what you need to do next:

1. Wait for the Workflow to Run
Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
Look for the workflow titled Deploy GitHub Pages.
It should show as “In progress” or “Completed.”
If it completes successfully:
You’ll see a green checkmark.
The website will be live at:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
If there’s an error:

Review the logs in the Actions tab to identify and fix any issues.
2. Check Your Website
Open your browser and go to:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
You should see the placeholder content defined in the workflow file (a basic HTML page).
3. Add Custom Content
Now that the site is live, you can start customising it.

Edit or Add Content:

Go back to your repository.
Add an index.html file or modify the content directly in the repository.
For example:
Create a more detailed homepage.
Add pages for "Team," "Projects," "Publications," etc.
Commit Changes:

Each time you update the website content (e.g., index.html or CSS files), commit and push your changes.
The workflow will automatically rebuild and update the site.
4. Add Styling and Assets
To make your website look professional:

Create a folder named assets in your repository for images, stylesheets, or scripts.
Add a CSS file to style your site. For example, create style.css and link it in your index.html:
html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
Add images or logos to the assets folder and use them in your HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo">
5. Optional: Use a Template
If you prefer a pre-designed look, use a static site generator (like Jekyll) or a GitHub Pages theme:

Browse themes at https://jekyllthemes.io/.
Download or clone a theme and replace your repository content with the theme files.
Let Me Know:
If you need help customising the site, such as:

Writing HTML for a specific section (e.g., "Team" or "Publications").
Linking CSS or JavaScript for styling.
Integrating a Jekyll theme.
You’re all set to make a fantastic webpage for your research group! 🚀







You said:

You said:
there is an error "Run actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
Run tar \
tar: _site/: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Error: Process completed with exit code 2."
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This error occurs because the workflow is looking for a directory _site/ that doesn’t exist. This usually happens if you are using a static site generator like Jekyll but haven’t set it up to generate the _site/ folder. Since we are building a simple HTML file for now, we can fix this by pointing the workflow to the correct directory.

Here’s how to fix it:

1. Modify the Workflow File
Open the github-pages.yml file in your GitHub repository.

Replace the Build static site step with a command that uses the correct directory.

Update the workflow to the following:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Build static site
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./public
          echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>ML-Health</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1><p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></html>" > ./public/index.html

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./public

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
This fix changes the output directory to ./public instead of _site/.

2. Commit the Changes
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Commit changes.
Add a commit message like:
rust
Copy
Edit
Fix workflow to use correct directory for GitHub Pages
3. Wait for the Workflow to Re-Run
Go to the Actions tab.
Watch for the workflow to trigger automatically.
If the workflow completes successfully, your site should now deploy correctly.
4. Check Your Site
Once the workflow finishes, visit your site at:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
Let me know if the error persists, and we can debug further!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Both warnings are related to upcoming updates in GitHub Actions and can be addressed to future-proof your workflow. Here’s how to fix them:

1. Fix Warning: ubuntu-latest Update to ubuntu-24.04
GitHub is transitioning the ubuntu-latest tag to use ubuntu-24.04. To avoid issues in the future, you can explicitly set ubuntu-24.04 in your workflow. Update the runs-on parameter:

In your github-pages.yml, replace:

yaml
Copy
Edit
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
With:

yaml
Copy
Edit
runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
2. Fix Warning: Deprecation of Artifact Actions (v4 Upgrade)
The artifact upload action needs to be updated to the latest version (v4). Update the upload-pages-artifact step in your workflow.

In your github-pages.yml, replace:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
  with:
    path: ./public
With:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
  with:
    path: ./public
3. Full Updated Workflow
After these updates, your workflow file should look like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Build static site
        run: |
          mkdir -p ./public
          echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>ML-Health</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1><p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></html>" > ./public/index.html

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: ./public

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
4. Commit Changes
Save the changes to your github-pages.yml file.
Add a commit message like:
css
Copy
Edit
Update workflow to use ubuntu-24.04 and upload-pages-artifact@v4
Click Commit changes.
5. Test the Workflow
Go to the Actions tab in your repository.
Wait for the workflow to run.
Ensure it completes successfully.
6. Verify the Site
Visit your site at:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
These changes will address the warnings and ensure your workflow is compatible with GitHub's latest requirements. Let me know if you encounter any issues!







You said:
I receive the error "deploy
Unable to resolve action actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4, unable to find version v4"
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that version v4 of actions/upload-pages-artifact does not exist. I made an incorrect assumption about the latest version. The correct version is currently v2. You can safely use v2 and resolve the deprecation warning by updating it to the officially supported version or replacing it with a newer recommended approach if GitHub introduces one in the future.

Let’s revert the step back to v2 and address the deprecation warning properly.

Correct Workflow File
Here is the updated workflow using v2 and keeping compatibility with the latest updates:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

      - name: Build static site
        run: |

If the workflow completed successfully but the website is not accessible, there are a few possible reasons and steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to Settings > Pages (in the sidebar under "Code and automation").
Verify the following:
Branch: Ensure it’s set to the main branch.
Folder/Directory: Ensure it’s pointing to the public directory or the appropriate output folder from your workflow.
If the source isn’t configured, select the correct options and save the settings.

2. Verify the Workflow Output
Go to the Actions tab.
Click on the latest workflow run.
Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" step and check the logs for any errors or warnings.
Ensure the correct directory (public) was uploaded successfully.
3. Check the GitHub Pages Deployment Status
Go to the Environments tab (below the Actions tab).
Look for the github-pages environment.
Click on it to see if the deployment completed successfully or if there were any errors.
4. Confirm the Website URL
The correct URL for your website should be:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
If it still doesn’t load:

Wait a few minutes, as it can take some time for GitHub Pages to propagate the changes.
5. Check for File Issues
Ensure that the index.html file exists in the public directory (as defined in your workflow).
If the file is missing, the deployment will succeed, but the website will show a 404 error.
6. Enable GitHub Pages (If Not Enabled)
If GitHub Pages is not enabled:

Go to Settings > Pages.
Under Build and deployment, ensure that GitHub Actions is selected as the source.
Save the configuration.
7. Re-Test Access
After completing the above steps, try accessing:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
Let me know if it still doesn’t work, and we can debug further!







You said:
in 1.3 I don't see these options. I can see: Source: GitHub Actions, below "GitHub Pages Jekyll" and "Static HTML", with buttons called "configure". I didn't configure anything. Then, "Custom domain" and "visibility" 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems your repository is already set to use GitHub Actions as the source for GitHub Pages. Since you didn’t configure any of the additional options, we should focus on verifying that the deployment output aligns with GitHub’s requirements for hosting static files.

Here’s what to do next:

1. Select the Correct Build Option
Under Settings > Pages, where you see:

GitHub Pages Jekyll
Static HTML
Action:
Click Configure next to Static HTML, as your site is using basic HTML files.
This configuration ensures GitHub knows you’re hosting plain HTML instead of using Jekyll or another framework.
2. Verify Output Directory in Your Workflow
Your github-pages.yml workflow currently outputs files to a public/ folder. GitHub Pages needs to be explicitly told to look for files in that folder.

Action:
Open your workflow file and ensure this part exists:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
  with:
    path: ./public
Then confirm that the Build step outputs the index.html file to the public/ folder:

yaml
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ./public
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>ML-Health</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to ML-Health</h1><p>Our research group focuses on machine learning for healthcare, specifically neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></html>" > ./public/index.html
3. Test Visibility
If you didn’t set the repository to public visibility, GitHub Pages may not make the site accessible.
Go to Settings > General.
Under Repository visibility, confirm the repository is Public.
4. Re-Trigger the Workflow
If you’ve made changes to the workflow or repository settings, re-trigger the workflow to redeploy the site:

Go to Actions.
Click the latest workflow run.
Re-run the workflow by selecting Re-run all jobs.
5. Final Check
After completing these steps:

Visit your site at:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
If it still doesn’t work:
Review the workflow logs for errors.
Ensure the index.html file exists in the deployment output.
Let me know how it goes!







You said:
In 1, is it better static or Jekyll?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The choice between Static HTML and Jekyll depends on your website's requirements and technical familiarity. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

1. Static HTML
Best for: Simple websites with minimal customisation, straightforward HTML/CSS, or when you’re manually building pages.

Pros:
Simplicity: No configuration is needed; GitHub will host and display your index.html and other files directly.
Flexibility: You have full control over the structure and content since you’re writing the HTML/CSS yourself.
Performance: Static HTML is fast and lightweight, as there’s no need for a generator to process files.
Cons:
Manual Work: If your site grows, adding and managing pages manually can become cumbersome.
No Pre-Built Features: You have to write everything from scratch (navigation, templating, etc.).
2. Jekyll
Best for: Websites with multiple pages, repeated layouts, or blog-like functionality, where templating and automation can save time.

Pros:
Automated Layouts: Use templates and partials to avoid repeating code across pages.
Markdown Support: Write content in Markdown, and Jekyll converts it to HTML.
Themes and Plugins: Easily customise your site with pre-built themes or extend functionality using plugins.
Efficient for Updates: Adding new pages or posts is simpler due to the templating system.
Cons:
Learning Curve: Requires basic knowledge of Jekyll or YAML (for configuration).
Build Time: Jekyll generates the site each time you push changes, which can slightly slow deployment.
More Setup: You’ll need to configure a _config.yml file and follow Jekyll’s folder structure.
When to Choose Static HTML
You only need a few pages (e.g., "Home," "Projects," "Team").
You’re comfortable writing HTML and CSS manually.
You want something quick and easy with minimal configuration.
When to Choose Jekyll
Your site has many pages or a blog/news section.
You want to use templates for consistency across pages.
You prefer writing in Markdown rather than HTML.
You might want to use a pre-built theme for a polished design.
Recommendation
For a simple research group site, Static HTML is often sufficient. You can always switch to Jekyll later if the site grows or you need advanced features.

Would you like guidance on setting up either option?







You said:
I will go for static
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Great choice! Going for Static HTML is straightforward and perfect for a simple, clean website. Here’s how to proceed:

Steps to Configure Static HTML
Go to GitHub Pages Settings:

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click Settings > Pages.
Select "Static HTML":

Under the Source section, where you see "GitHub Pages Jekyll" and "Static HTML," click Configure next to Static HTML.
This tells GitHub Pages to serve your plain HTML files without applying Jekyll processing.
3. Ensure Your index.html Exists
For Static HTML, your website’s homepage must be named index.html. This file should be in the root of your repository (or the folder specified in your workflow, such as public/).

If you already have an index.html, confirm it contains the desired content.

If not, create one. Here’s a simple example:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>ML-Health Research Group</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group</h1>
    <p>Our research focuses on machine learning for healthcare, particularly neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Email: researchgroup@example.com</p>
</body>
</html>
4. Commit Your Files
Add the index.html file to your repository (if it’s not already there).
You can do this via the GitHub web editor or by pushing changes from your local machine.
If using a workflow:
Ensure the index.html is in the public/ directory as defined in your workflow file.
Re-run the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy it.
5. Verify Deployment
After the static HTML configuration:

Wait for GitHub Pages to process the changes (it can take a few minutes).
Visit your site at:
cpp
Copy
Edit
https://MartaVallejo.github.io/ML-Health
You should see the content of your index.html.
6. Customise Your Website
You can now add additional HTML files (e.g., team.html, projects.html) and link them from the homepage. For example:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="team.html">Meet the Team</a>
<a href="projects.html">Our Projects</a>
Let me know if you encounter any issues or need help with further customisation! 🎉

You said:
how should I add the folder assets in the repository?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add the assets folder to your GitHub repository, you can do it either directly through GitHub's web interface or locally using your computer. Here are the steps for both methods:

Option 1: Using the GitHub Web Interface
Go to Your Repository:

Open your repository on GitHub.
Create a New Folder:

Click on the Add file dropdown at the top right of the file list.
Select Create new file.
Name the File to Create the Folder:

In the "Name your file..." field, type:
bash
Copy
Edit
assets/style.css
GitHub will interpret this as creating a folder named assets and a file named style.css inside it.
Add Your CSS Content:

In the text editor, paste the CSS code (or leave it blank for now).
Commit the File:

Scroll down and add a commit message like:
sql
Copy
Edit
Add assets folder and style.css
Click Commit new file.
Option 2: Using Local Files and Git
Create the Folder Locally:

On your computer, navigate to your repository folder.
Create a new folder named assets:
On Windows: Right-click and select New > Folder.
On macOS/Linux: Use the terminal:
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir assets
Create the CSS File:

Inside the assets folder, create a file named style.css.

To address the issue of the header and top of the page having two almost identical grey colours, we can harmonise the design by adjusting the header background colour and ensuring a consistent contrast. Here's an improved version of your CSS:

Updated CSS
css
Copy
Edit
/* style.css */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f9f9f9; /* Light grey for page background */
    color: #333; /* Dark grey for text */
}

/* Header and Footer Styling */
header {
    background-color: #005f73; /* Deep teal for better contrast and elegance */
    color: #fff; /* White text for visibility */
    padding: 10px 20px;
}

footer {
    background-color: #003f5c; /* Darker shade of teal for footer */
    color: #fff; /* White text */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

header nav a, footer a {
    color: #fff; /* White text for links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

header nav a:hover, footer a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/* Main Content Styling */
main {
    padding: 20px;
}

h1, h2 {
    color: #444; /* Dark grey for headings */
}

/* Article Styling */
article {
    background: #fff; /* White background for articles */
    border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Light grey border */
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 15px 0;
    padding: 15px;
}

article h3 {
    color: #005f73; /* Match header teal for headings inside articles */
}

/* Header Logo and Navigation Styling */
header img {
    vertical-align: middle;
}

header nav a {
    margin: 0 10px;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #fff; /* White text for navigation links */
}

header nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Key Changes:
Header Background Colour: Changed to #005f73 (deep teal) for a professional, elegant look and clear differentiation from the light grey background.
Footer Background Colour: Updated to a darker teal #003f5c for contrast with the header.
Consistent Colours: The headings inside articles now use the same teal colour as the header for a unified design.
Improved Contrast: The navigation links and text remain white for readability.
How to Apply:
Replace your current style.css file content with the updated CSS above.
Save and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

/* Header and Footer Styling */

    color: #fff; /* White text for clear readability */
    padding: 10px 20px;

    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

header nav a:hover, footer a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #ffffff; /* Pure white on hover for emphasis */
}

/* Main Content Styling */
main {
    padding: 20px;
}

h1, h2 {
    color: #444; /* Dark grey for headings */

/* Header Logo and Navigation Styling */
header img {
    vertical-align: middle;
}

header nav a {
    margin: 0 10px;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #e0e0e0; /* Light grey links for readability */
}

header nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #ffffff; /* White text for hover effect */
}
Key Changes:
Unified Header and Footer: Both use #003f5c (a dark teal) to ensure consistency across the page.
Text Readability: Header text and links use #e0e0e0 (light grey) for better contrast with the dark background, while hover effects highlight links with pure white (#ffffff).
Cohesive Colours: Article headings and other key elements now use the same dark teal colour to tie the design together.

If the header (top section) of your page is not displaying as expected, it could be due to one of the following issues:

1. CSS Conflict
Check if the CSS applied to the header is overriding styles in a way that makes the header invisible or improperly displayed. For example:

Header background colour: Ensure the header background and text colours are contrasting.
Flexbox properties: Confirm the display: flex; and justify-content: space-between; styles are correctly applied to the header div.
2. Logo Images Not Found
If the images for the ML-Health group logo (ml-health-logo.png) or Heriot-Watt logo (heriot-watt-logo.png) are missing or not in the correct directory (images folder), the header might appear broken. Verify:

The images are correctly uploaded to the images folder in your repository.
The paths in the <img> tags are accurate.
3. HTML Structure
Make sure the <header> tag is properly closed and there are no syntax errors in the HTML.

Debugging Steps
Test Without Logos: Temporarily remove the <img> tags in the header to check if the issue is with the image paths or sizes:

html
Copy
Edit
<header>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
        <!-- Left: Placeholder for Logo -->
        <div>
            <a href="index.html">ML-Health</a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Navigation Menu -->
        <nav>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
            <a href="team.html">Team</a> |
            <a href="students.html">Students</a> |
            <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> |
            <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        </nav>

        <!-- Right: Placeholder for Logo -->
        <div>
            <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Heriot-Watt</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</header>
Check Header Styles: Ensure that the header styles in style.css are properly applied:

css
Copy
Edit
header {
    background-color: #003f5c; /* Ensure this matches the footer colour */
    color: #fff;
    padding: 10px 20px;
}

header nav a {
    color: #e0e0e0; /* Text is readable against background */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

header nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #ffffff;
}

header img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    height: 50px; /* Ensure a standard height for logos */
}
Validate the HTML: Use an online HTML validator like W3C Validator to ensure there are no syntax issues.

Final Steps
Verify the file paths for the logo images:
images/ml-health-logo.png
images/heriot-watt-logo.png
Refresh your browser and check the header.
If the issue persists, inspect the element in your browser developer tools (right-click on the page and select Inspect) to identify any rendering issues.
Let me know if you'd like further assistance or a step-by-step guide for any specific debugging! 😊

The "<h1>Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group</h1>" has disappeared in the last version of the index.html. This first part was the one with the same colour as the footer. I want this part on top of the menu.

Here’s an updated version of your index.html where the <h1> ("Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group") is restored above the navigation menu and styled to match the footer background colour for consistency. This will place the header text prominently at the top of the page.

Key Changes:
Title Restored:

The <h1> ("Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group") is placed in its own section at the very top of the page.
It uses the same dark teal (#003f5c) background as the footer for consistency.
The text colour is white (#fff) for readability.
Navigation and Logos:

The navigation menu and logos remain in the second section of the header, keeping the layout clean.
Improved Readability:

Links in the navigation menu are styled with a light grey (#e0e0e0) and turn white (#fff) on hover for better visibility.
Styling Consistency in style.css:
Update your CSS to ensure consistency and improve visual hierarchy:

css
Copy
Edit
header {
    background-color: #003f5c; /* Unified dark teal for both header sections */
    color: #fff;
}

header h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin: 0;
}

header nav a {
    color: #e0e0e0;
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

header nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #ffffff;
}

header img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    height: 50px;
}
Steps to Implement:
Replace your current index.html with the updated version above.
Ensure your style.css file is updated with the new header styles.
Test the page in your browser to confirm the header text and navigation appear correctly.
Let me know if there are additional tweaks you’d like! 😊

Here's an updated version of your index.html where the "Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group" section has a distinct colour, and the logos are aligned with the title rather than the menu. This creates a cleaner separation between the title, logos, and menu.

Key Changes
Distinct Colour for the Title Section:

The title section (Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group) uses a lighter teal (#005f73) for contrast with the darker navigation menu background (#003f5c).
Logo Alignment:

Logos are in line with the title, creating a cohesive and visually balanced layout.
Navigation Menu Styling:

The menu remains centred and distinct below the title and logos, with links styled for readability.
Styling Updates for style.css
To refine the appearance, add these styles to your style.css file:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Title Section */
header h1 {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
}

/* Navigation Menu */
header nav a {
    color: #e0e0e0; /* Light grey links for readability */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

header nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #ffffff; /* White on hover */
}

/* Logo Styling */
header img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    height: 50px;
}
Steps to Implement
Replace your current index.html with the updated version.
Add the new CSS styles to your style.css file.
Upload the updated logo files (ml-health-logo.png and heriot-watt-logo.png) to the images folder in your repository.
Test the webpage to ensure everything displays as intended.
Let me know if further adjustments are needed! 😊

The issue is caused by conflicting styles applied to the navigation menu (<nav>). Specifically, the text-align: center; inside the inline styles of the <nav> element is not taking full effect due to the surrounding container's properties.

To fix this and ensure the menu is centred properly, follow these steps:

Fix: Update HTML and CSS
HTML Changes
Modify the <nav> section to remove inline styles and use CSS instead. This keeps the code cleaner and easier to maintain:

<header>
    <!-- Top Section: Title and Logos -->
    <div style="background-color: #005f73; color: #fff; padding: 20px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">

            <a href="index.html">

            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Title -->
        <div>
            <h1 style="margin: 0;">Welcome to the ML-Health Research Group</h1>
        </div>

        <!-- Right: Heriot-Watt University Logo -->
        <div>
            <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/heriot-watt-logo.png" alt="Heriot-Watt University Logo" style="height: 50px;">
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Bottom Section: Navigation Menu -->
    <div style="background-color: #003f5c; padding: 10px;">
        <nav>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
            <a href="team.html">Team</a> |
            <a href="students.html">Students</a> |
            <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> |
            <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        </nav>
    </div>
</header>
CSS Changes
Add these styles to your style.css file to ensure the navigation menu is properly centred:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Navigation Menu Styling */
header nav {
    text-align: center; /* Centers the menu text */
    margin: 0; /* Removes any unwanted spacing */
}

header nav a {
    color: #e0e0e0; /* Light grey for readability */
    text-decoration: none; /* Removes underline */
    margin: 0 10px; /* Adds spacing between links */
    font-size: 1rem; /* Standard font size */
}

header nav a:hover {
    color: #ffffff; /* White on hover */
    text-decoration: underline; /* Underline on hover for emphasis */
}
Why This Works
Container Alignment:

The text-align: center; applied directly to the <nav> ensures all menu links are centred within their container.
Margin and Spacing:

The margin: 0 10px; ensures consistent spacing between menu items without pushing the entire menu off-centre.
Inline vs. CSS:

Moving the styles to CSS ensures there are no conflicts with other properties applied to the <nav> or its parent container.
Final Check
Replace the relevant parts of your index.html and style.css with the updates above.
Reload the webpage and verify that:
The menu is centred below the title section.
The spacing between menu items is consistent.
Hover effects work as expected.
Let me know if it still doesn’t look right! 😊

What’s Fixed:
Restored Logos:

Logos for the ML-Health group and Heriot-Watt University are back in the top section (#welcome-section).
Logos are correctly aligned with the title.
Full Menu Restored:

The navigation menu includes all options: Home, Projects, Team, Students, Publications, Collaboration, and Contact.
Improved Layout:

The title remains centred in the top section, with logos on the left and right.
The navigation menu is centred and separated below the title section.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts well to different screen sizes due to flexbox in the header.
Next Steps:
Replace the content of your index.html with this updated version.
Ensure your CSS file matches the updated styles in my previous messages.
Verify that the images/ml-health-logo.png and images/heriot-watt-logo.png files are correctly uploaded.
Test the webpage to ensure everything works and looks as expected.
Let me know if there’s anything else I can improve! 😊

You said:
why I can see blues in the page?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're seeing blue elements on your page despite defining a dark gray and cream colour palette, this could be due to the following reasons:

Common Causes for Unexpected Blue Colours
Default Styles of Links (<a> Tags):

Browsers apply a default blue colour to hyperlinks if no specific colour is defined in the CSS.
Ensure all links (<a> tags) have explicit styles in your CSS.
Example:

css
Copy
Edit
a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for links */
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Unstyled Form Elements (e.g., Buttons, Inputs):

Buttons and inputs can have default blue borders or highlights when focused or active. Add explicit styles to override these.
Example:

css
Copy
Edit
button {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text */
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #4f4f4f; /* Lighter gray on hover */
}

input, textarea {
    border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Light gray border */
    background-color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream background */
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray text */
}

input:focus, textarea:focus {
    outline: none;
    border-color: #4f4f4f; /* Lighter gray border on focus */
}
Browser Default Styles (User-Agent Stylesheets):

Browsers have default styles (called user-agent stylesheets) that might add blue colours to elements such as links, form elements, or visited links.
Reset these by explicitly overriding them in your CSS.
Example:

css
Copy
Edit
a:visited {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream for visited links */
}

a:active {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for active links */
}
External CSS or Framework Conflicts:
If your project includes external stylesheets (e.g., Bootstrap or Material Design), these may introduce conflicting styles.
Check for conflicts by inspecting the elements in your browser’s developer tools (right-click on the element and select "Inspect").
CSS Not Properly Linked:
Ensure your CSS file is correctly linked in the <head> section of your HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
Steps to Resolve the Issue
Update Your CSS: Add the following styles to ensure no blue defaults are visible:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Override Link Colours */
a, a:visited {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream */
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream */
}

/* Override Button and Form Defaults */
button, input, textarea {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream */
    border: 1px solid #4f4f4f; /* Lighter gray border */
}

button:hover, input:focus, textarea:focus {
    border-color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream on focus/hover */
}
Check for Conflicting Styles: Use developer tools in your browser to inspect the blue elements and identify which styles are being applied.

Clear Browser Cache:

If changes aren’t reflecting, clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).
Outcome
Once these steps are applied, all blue elements will be replaced with the dark gray and cream colours defined in your palette. Let me know if you still see blue elements or need further assistance! 😊







You said:
i see that there are some colours in the index.html
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If there are colours defined directly in the HTML (inline styles or hardcoded), they will override the CSS styles. To fix this, you should remove the inline styles and ensure all styling is handled through the CSS file for consistency and maintainability.

Steps to Remove Colours from index.html
Here’s an updated version of your index.html with all inline styles (like style="...") removed:

What Was Fixed
Removed Inline Styles:

Eliminated all style="..." attributes from the HTML. For example:
<div style="background-color: #005f73; ..."> → Replaced with CSS-only styling.
Moved Styling to CSS:

Now all colours and layout definitions are managed via style.css, ensuring consistency.
Improved Maintainability:

Any changes to colours or design can now be made in a single place (the CSS file).
Updated CSS (style.css)
Add these styles to ensure the layout and colours are applied correctly:

To make the logos larger while maintaining a consistent and responsive design, you can adjust their size in the CSS. Here’s an updated version of the CSS and the relevant HTML changes:

Updated CSS (style.css)
css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling */
header {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray for header background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text */
}

#welcome-section {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 20px;
}

#welcome-section img {
    height: 80px; /* Increase the logo height */
    max-width: 150px; /* Limit the maximum width for responsiveness */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

header h1 {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}
HTML Updates
No major changes are required in the HTML, but ensure the <img> tags for the logos are correctly placed in the index.html:

<!-- Left: ML-Health Group Logo -->
<div>
    <a href="index.html">
        <img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo">
    </a>
</div>

<!-- Right: Heriot-Watt University Logo -->
<div>
    <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
        <img src="images/heriot-watt-logo.png" alt="Heriot-Watt University Logo">
    </a>
</div>
Explanation of Changes
Increased Logo Height:

The height of the logos is set to 80px to make them larger.
Responsive Design:

Added max-width: 150px; to ensure logos don’t stretch disproportionately on smaller screens.
Consistent Alignment:

The vertical-align: middle; ensures the logos align properly with other content.
Preview
With these changes:

The logos will appear larger while remaining proportional.
The layout will remain responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Let me know if further adjustments are needed! 😊

3. Explanation:

HTML Structure:

The publications are grouped by year using <div class="publication-year">.
Each publication is listed within an unordered list <ul>, with individual publications as list items <li>.
For each publication, the title is enclosed in <strong>, authors in <em>, and the publication source/date in a <a> tag linking to the source.
CSS Styling:

The #publications section has a cream background and dark gray text to maintain the site's color scheme.
Year headings (.publication-year h3) have a slightly lighter gray color and a bottom border for separation.
Publication titles, authors, and source links are styled for clarity, with links in blue to indicate clickability.

Save and Test:

Save your changes and reload the publications.html page to verify the new layout and styles.
Review for Consistency:

Ensure the publications page fits seamlessly with the overall design of your site.

Changes Made
Compact Layout:

Reduced the margin between publications to 10px (.publication-year li).
Made each publication a flex container (display: flex) for better alignment.
Coloured Backgrounds:

Year sections have a white background (#ffffff) to contrast against the cream main section (#f9f7f3).
Borders and subtle shadows make sections visually distinct without taking too much space.
Reduced Font Sizes:

Links (a) have a slightly smaller font size (0.9rem) to fit more content without overwhelming the page.
Compact Year Sections:

Added a light border and padding to the year containers for better structure.
Responsive Design:

Used flex-wrap: wrap; to ensure publications adapt well to smaller screens.
How It Looks
Year Sections: Clean blocks with subtle borders and shadows.
Publications: Compact list items with reduced spacing and better alignment.
Links: Push to the right for cleaner alignment, with hover effects for interactivity.
Updated HTML Example for Compact Display

What’s New:
Navigation Menu at the Top:

Includes links to all main sections of the site, including "Home."
Styled consistently with your existing design.
"Back to Home" Link:

A clearly visible link at the top of the publications section for easy navigation.
Styled separately from the menu for prominence and flexibility.
Hover Effects:

Both the menu and the "Back to Home" link include hover effects to enhance usability.
How It Works:
Users can navigate back using either:
The main navigation menu (persistent across all pages).
The "Back to Home" link (specific to the publications page for extra convenience).
The CSS ensures these elements are styled to match the rest of the site.

    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream hover effect */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Where to Add the Menu
Projects Page (projects.html): Place the <nav> element directly inside the <header> tag at the top of the page.

Other Pages: Ensure the same <nav> menu is used consistently on all pages (e.g., index.html, publications.html, etc.).

Example of a Consistent Header
Here’s an example of how the header with the menu should look:

html
Copy
Edit
<header>
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>
        <a href="team.html">Team</a>
        <a href="students.html">Students</a>
        <a href="publications.html">Publications</a>
        <a href="collaboration.html">Collaboration</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
Steps to Update
Ensure the navigation menu is added to every page of the site.
Test the navigation links to ensure all options work correctly.
Use the consistent CSS styles provided to maintain a unified design.

Updated CSS
Add the following styles to your style.css to style the page title block consistently with the rest of your site:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Page Title Block Styling */
.page-title {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray for the background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for readability */
    text-align: center;
    padding: 20px 0;
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Adds spacing below the title block */
}

.page-title h1 {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: bold;
}
Explanation of Changes
Added a Title Block:

The <div class="page-title"> contains a centered title (<h1>Our Students</h1>) to introduce the page clearly.
Styled Consistently:

The title block matches the dark gray and cream colour palette used in other parts of your site.
CSS Adjustments:

Added a margin-bottom to separate the title block from the main content.
Used a larger font size (2rem) for the title for prominence.
Result
After implementing these changes, your students.html page will have:

A title block at the top with the title "Our Students."
A clean and consistent layout across all pages.

The issue arises because the page title block (<div class="page-title">) is placed outside the <header> but is not styled to take up the full width or stack correctly with the navigation and logos. Let’s fix this by ensuring that the title block integrates seamlessly with the rest of the header.

Explanation of Fixes
Title Block Integrated into Header:

The <div class="page-title"> is now placed inside the <header> tag to avoid layout inconsistencies.
Consistent Header Background:

The header retains a cream background (#f9f7f3), matching the overall site theme.
Navigation and Logos:

The navigation menu (<nav>) and logos are aligned with flexbox for a consistent layout.
Title Styling:

The title (Our Students) has a bold font and dark gray background (#333333) to distinguish it from other sections.
Result
The "Our Students" title will:

Appear at the very top, above the navigation menu and logos.
Be styled with a distinct dark gray background and cream text for emphasis.

Updated CSS for Header
Add the following styles to your style.css to style the header and logos:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling */
header {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray for header background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for readability */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; /* Adds a subtle separation line */
}

/* Header Content: Logos and Title */
.header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Space out the two logos and title */
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.header-content h1 {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    flex-grow: 1; /* Ensure the title occupies remaining space */
    text-align: center;
}

/* Logo Styling */
.logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Standardize logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu Styling */
header nav {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1rem;
}

header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for navigation links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Explanation of Changes
Header Layout:

The <div class="header-content"> wraps the two logos and the title, styled with display: flex; for alignment.
The title (<h1>Our Projects</h1>) is centered between the logos using flex-grow: 1.
Logos Styling:

Each logo is placed inside a <div class="logo"> for consistent size and spacing.
The height of both logos is standardized to 50px.
Navigation Menu:

Positioned below the logos and title for a clean layout.
Styled with consistent colors and hover effects.
Result
The "Our Projects" title will appear centered in the header.
The ML-Health logo will appear on the left, and the Heriot-Watt logo will appear on the right.
The navigation menu will remain below the title and logos.

You said:
is this css only for the projects page? because the other pages work well. 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The CSS I provided is specifically designed for the header of the projects page but will also affect headers on other pages if you include the .header-content or modify the <header> styles globally. Since the other pages already work well, you can isolate the styles for the projects page by using a specific class or ID for the header on the projects page.

Updated HTML for projects.html (Add Specific ID to Header)
To ensure the styles only apply to the projects page, add an ID to the <header> tag, like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="projects-header">
    <div class="header-content">
        <!-- Left: ML-Health Group Logo -->
        <div class="logo">
            <a href="index.html">
                <img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo" style="height: 50px;">
            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Title -->
        <h1>Our Projects</h1>

        <!-- Right: Heriot-Watt University Logo -->

Updated CSS for projects.html (Scoped Styles)
Use the ID #projects-header in the CSS to ensure the styles only apply to the header on the projects page:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling for Projects Page Only */
#projects-header {
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray for header background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for readability */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; /* Adds a subtle separation line */
}

/* Header Content: Logos and Title for Projects Page */
#projects-header .header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Space out the two logos and title */
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

#projects-header .header-content h1 {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    flex-grow: 1; /* Ensure the title occupies remaining space */
    text-align: center;
}

/* Logo Styling for Projects Page */
#projects-header .logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Standardize logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu Styling for Projects Page */
#projects-header nav {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1rem;
}

#projects-header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for navigation links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

#projects-header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Benefits of Using Scoped Styles
Isolated to Projects Page:

By targeting #projects-header, the CSS will only affect the header on the projects page and not headers on other pages.
Maintains Consistency Elsewhere:

Other pages continue using their existing header design without changes.
Easy to Modify:

Any future updates to the projects page header can be done independently without affecting other pages.
Steps to Implement
Add the id="projects-header" to the <header> tag on projects.html.
Update your style.css file to include the scoped styles above.
Test the projects page to ensure the header displays correctly.
Check other pages to confirm their headers remain unaffected.

Explanation of Fixes
Flexbox Alignment for header-content:

Used display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; to align the logos on the left and right, with the title in the center.
Space Allocation:

Added flex-basis: 15%; to the .logo containers so the logos occupy consistent space without crowding the title.
Set flex-grow: 1; on the <h1> to ensure the title occupies the remaining space between the logos.
Logo Styling:

Both logos (ML-Health and Heriot-Watt) are limited to height: 50px; to maintain consistency and ensure proper alignment.
Navigation Menu:

Positioned below the logos and title with consistent spacing and hover effects.
Result
The ML-Health logo appears on the left.
The title ("Our Projects") is perfectly centered.
The Heriot-Watt logo appears on the right.
The navigation menu is centered below the header content.

You said:
but if the location of the logos are ok for the rest of the pages, if I change the CSS to fix only this page, I can mess up the rest. It should be away of fixing it without changing the CSS of the whole pages
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right. To ensure the changes affect only the projects page, we can scope the styling specifically to this page by using an ID on the <header> element (e.g., id="projects-header") and updating only that ID's styles in your CSS.

Here’s how to fix the alignment only for the projects page without impacting the other pages:

Updated HTML for projects.html
Add a unique ID to the <header> element:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="projects-header">
    <div class="header-content">
        <!-- Left: ML-Health Group Logo -->
        <div class="logo left-logo">

                <img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo" style="height: 50px;">
            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Title -->
        <h1>Our Projects</h1>

Scoped CSS for projects.html
Add the following styles to your style.css file. These styles will only apply to the header of the projects page (#projects-header) and will not affect other pages:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling for Projects Page Only */
#projects-header .header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Logos on either side, title in the center */
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

#projects-header .header-content .logo {
    flex-basis: 15%; /* Allow logos to take up consistent space */
}

#projects-header .header-content h1 {
    flex-grow: 1; /* Title occupies remaining space */
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

#projects-header .header-content .logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Standardize logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu for Projects Page */
#projects-header nav {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1rem;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

#projects-header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for navigation links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

#projects-header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Key Points
ID-Based Styling:

By targeting #projects-header in the CSS, these styles apply only to the header on the projects page.
The layout and appearance of headers on other pages remain unaffected.
No Global Changes:

The rest of the website continues to use the original CSS without any modifications.
Scalable Solution:

If you need specific styles for other pages, you can use similar scoped CSS by assigning unique IDs to their headers.
Steps to Implement
Add the id="projects-header" to the <header> element on projects.html.
Add the scoped CSS provided above to your style.css file.
Verify that:
The logos and title are correctly aligned on the projects page.
Headers on other pages are unaffected.

You said:
how I do this? "Add the id="projects-header" to the <header> element on projects.html."
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add the id="projects-header" to the <header> element on projects.html, follow these steps:

Steps:
Locate Your projects.html File
Open the file in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, or even a plain text editor).

Find the <header> Element
Look for the <header> section at the top of the file. It will typically look something like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<header>
    <div class="header-content">
        <!-- Header content here -->
    </div>
</header>
Add the id="projects-header" Attribute
Modify the <header> tag to include the id="projects-header". The updated tag will look like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="projects-header">
    <div class="header-content">
        <!-- Header content here -->
    </div>
</header>
Save the File
After making the change, save the projects.html file.

Test the Change

Open the projects page (projects.html) in a browser to verify that the styling for the header is now specific to the projects page.
Ensure that headers on other pages remain unaffected.
Final Example of Updated projects.html
Here’s how the full <header> section will look with the id="projects-header" added:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="projects-header">
    <div class="header-content">

                <img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo" style="height: 50px;">
            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Title -->

        <a href="collaboration.html">Collaboration</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
Why Add the ID?
By adding id="projects-header", you can target this header specifically in your CSS using #projects-header. This ensures that any custom styles for the projects page don’t affect headers on other pages.

You said:
still the logo of HWU appear on the left instead on the right?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the Heriot-Watt University logo appears on the left instead of the right, it means the flexbox layout isn't distributing the content as intended. This can happen if the <div> elements inside .header-content aren't properly aligned.

Here’s how to fix it:

Corrected CSS for #projects-header
css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Content: Logos and Title for Projects Page */
#projects-header .header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Logos on either side, title in the center */
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

#projects-header .header-content .logo {
    flex: 0 0 auto; /* Logos stay fixed in size and position */
}

#projects-header .header-content h1 {
    flex-grow: 1; /* Title takes up the space between the logos */
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Ensure logos stay aligned and properly sized */
#projects-header .header-content .logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Standardize logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}
Explanation of Fixes
flex: 0 0 auto; on Logos:

Ensures that the logos (ML-Health and Heriot-Watt) maintain their assigned positions on the left and right, respectively, without expanding or shifting unexpectedly.
flex-grow: 1; on Title:

The title (<h1>Our Projects</h1>) will stretch to occupy all available space between the logos, keeping them aligned at opposite ends.
justify-content: space-between;:

Spaces out the content within .header-content so the two logos stay at opposite ends, with the title centered.
Updated HTML for projects.html
Ensure your HTML matches the corrected structure below:

html
Copy
Edit
<header id="projects-header">
    <div class="header-content">
        <!-- Left: ML-Health Group Logo -->
        <div class="logo left-logo">

Troubleshooting Tips
Test Layout in Browser:

Open the projects page in your browser to confirm the ML-Health logo is on the left, the title is centered, and the Heriot-Watt logo is on the right.
Inspect with Developer Tools:

Right-click the header in your browser and select "Inspect" to ensure the flex properties (flex-grow, justify-content, etc.) are applied correctly to .header-content and its children.
Ensure No Global CSS Conflicts:

Make sure no global styles (e.g., for .logo) are overriding these scoped styles.

Scoped CSS for team.html
To ensure these styles apply only to the team page, use the ID #team-header in your CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling for Team Page Only */
#team-header .header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Logos on either side, title in the center */
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

#team-header .header-content .logo {
    flex: 0 0 auto; /* Logos stay fixed in size and position */
}

#team-header .header-content h1 {
    flex-grow: 1; /* Title takes up the space between the logos */
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Logo Styling */
#team-header .header-content .logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Standardize logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu for Team Page */
#team-header nav {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1rem;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

#team-header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for navigation links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

#team-header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Why Use Scoped Styles?
Page-Specific Design:
The ID #team-header ensures that the logos and layout affect only the team page, leaving other pages unaffected.

Consistency Across Pages with Custom Needs:
Other pages like projects and contact can retain their unique designs without interference.

Final Steps
Update team.html:
Add the updated header structure from above.

Update style.css:
Add the scoped CSS to your stylesheet.

Test the Page:
Open the team page in your browser and verify:

ML-Health logo is on the left.
Heriot-Watt logo is on the right.
The title is centered.

To ensure the Heriot-Watt University logo appears on the right (and the ML-Health logo stays on the left) while the title remains centered, we need to properly configure the flexbox layout. Here's the corrected solution:

Corrected Scoped CSS for team.html
Add the following styles to your style.css file. These styles are scoped to the team page using the #team-header ID:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Content for Team Page */
#team-header .header-content {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Logos on opposite sides, title in the center */
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

#team-header .header-content .logo {
    flex: 0 0 auto; /* Prevent logos from stretching */
}

#team-header .header-content h1 {
    flex-grow: 1; /* Title occupies remaining space between logos */
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Logo Styling */
#team-header .header-content .logo img {
    height: 50px; /* Ensure consistent logo height */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu for Team Page */
#team-header nav {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1rem;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

#team-header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream for navigation links */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

#team-header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Explanation of Fixes
justify-content: space-between;:

Distributes the logos to opposite sides of the header, with the title remaining in the center.
flex-grow: 1; on Title:

Ensures the title spans the space between the logos and stays centered.
Scoped to #team-header:

These styles only apply to the team page header, avoiding changes to other pages.
Steps to Test
Save the Changes:

Update the team.html file with the corrected HTML.
Add the updated CSS to your style.css file.
Open the Team Page in Browser:

Verify that:
ML-Health logo is on the left.
Heriot-Watt logo is on the right.
The title is perfectly centered.
Ensure Other Pages Are Unaffected:

Check the headers on other pages to confirm they remain unchanged.

Each academic member has a name (<h3>), description (<p>), and a link to their Heriot-Watt University research profile.
Improved Layout:

Each member’s profile is styled as a card using flexbox for a clean layout.
Photos are circular (border-radius: 50%;) and aligned to the left.
Steps to Implement
Update team.html:
Replace the main section with the updated HTML.

Update style.css:
Add the provided CSS to your stylesheet.

Add Images:
Place member photos in the images/ folder and update the src paths in the <img> tags.

Features
Box Layout:

Each team member is presented in a box (.member-box) with their photo on the left and their details on the right.
Hover Effects:

The box slightly enlarges (transform: scale(1.02)) and adds a stronger shadow on hover for a more interactive feel.
Profile Photos:

Circular photos (border-radius: 50%) ensure a polished appearance.
Fixed size of 100px for uniformity.
Responsive Design:

The layout adapts well to various screen sizes because of the flexible container (display: flex; align-items: center;).
Link Styling:

Links to research profiles are highlighted in blue with an underline on hover.
Steps to Implement
Update team.html:
Replace the main section with the updated HTML.

Update style.css:
Add the provided CSS styles to your stylesheet.

Add Images:
Place the images for each academic member in the images/ folder and update the src paths in the <img> tags.

Test Your Page:
Open the team page in your browser to verify:

Boxes are styled properly.
Photos are displayed on the left, with names, descriptions, and links on the right.
Let me know if further tweaks are needed! 😊

For the research profile, can you tell me how to modify in a way that if clicks opens in a different page?
ChatGPT said:

To make the Research Profile links open in a new page or browser tab, you can use the target="_blank" attribute inside the <a> tag.

Here’s an example:

Example of a Link That Opens in a New Page

            </div>
        </div>
    </section>
</main>
CSS (No Changes Needed)
No changes to the CSS are required. The links will still inherit the existing styles (e.g., colour, hover effects).

Steps to Implement
Update the HTML File:

Add target="_blank" to all <a> tags linking to research profiles.
Test the Links:

Click the links in your browser to confirm they open in a new tab or window.

To fix the issue so that the logos appear along with the title (instead of alongside the menu), we can restructure the HTML and CSS so that the logos and title are in one block at the top, with the navigation menu below.

</header>
Explanation of Fixes
Logos and Title in the Same Block:

The logos and the title are placed in the same div with display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; for proper alignment.
Navigation Menu Below the Title:

The navigation menu is now a separate block placed below the title and logos.
Centered Title:

The title (<h1>Our Students</h1>) is centered using flex-grow: 1; and text-align: center.
Adjusted Logo Size:

The logo heights are slightly increased to 60px for better visibility.
CSS Adjustments (Optional)
If needed, you can include additional CSS in your style.css file to refine the appearance:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Header Styling for Students Page */
header h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
    color: #333333;
    margin: 0;
}

nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3;
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
}

nav a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: #e0d6b9;
}

header img {
    height: 60px;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
Result
Logos and Title: Both logos will now appear on either side of the title at the top of the page.
Navigation Menu: The menu will remain below the title and logos.
The layout is consistent with your design preferences and ensures readability.

Key Fixes
Title Positioned with Logos:

The title (<h1>Collaboration</h1>) is placed between the logos in the same flex container.
The flex-grow: 1; ensures the title is centered.
Consistent Header Layout:

Logos and title now appear at the top of the page, with the navigation menu placed below.
Responsive Design:

The flexbox ensures proper alignment across different screen sizes.
Steps to Test
Save the File:
Save the corrected HTML as collaboration.html.

Open in Browser:
Verify that:

The ML-Health logo appears on the left.
The "Collaboration" title is centered.
The Heriot-Watt University logo appears on the right.
The navigation menu is below the title.

You said:
I think the problem with the title of the collaboration section is due to the colour that it is not different from the background. Can be this the cause?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, if the title colour blends with the background colour, it can make the title appear as if it is missing. This issue is common when light text is displayed on a light background (e.g., cream on cream).

To resolve this, you can update the CSS to ensure the title text in the collaboration section has a colour that contrasts well with the background.

CSS Fix for Collaboration Section Title
Add the following CSS to your style.css file:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Collaboration Section Title */
#collaborators h2 {
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
    font-size: 2rem;
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray for better contrast */
}
Key Adjustments
Text Colour (color):

Set the title colour to #333333 (dark gray) to provide strong contrast against the cream background (#f9f7f3).
Font Size:

Ensure the title is visually prominent with font-size: 2rem.
Testing
Save the CSS Changes:
Update your style.css file with the new styles.

Refresh the Collaboration Page:
Open the page in your browser to verify that:

The title "Our Collaborators" is now clearly visible.
The colour contrasts well with the background.
Let me know if you need further assistance! 😊

You said:
now all the titles disappeared, with the last CSS upload, do you know why?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue with the disappearing titles is likely caused by conflicting styles in the last CSS upload. Specifically, the title elements (<h1> and <h2>) might have inherited unintended properties (e.g., visibility: hidden, color: transparent, or a very small font size).

Let’s debug and fix the issue.

Steps to Identify and Fix the Problem
Inspect the Elements:

Open the affected page in your browser.
Right-click the title (or its location) and select Inspect.
Look at the applied CSS rules in the developer tools to confirm if:
The title has visibility: hidden or display: none.
The title’s color matches the background (making it invisible).
The font-size is too small to render visibly.
Correct Global CSS Rules:

Ensure no global CSS rules (e.g., targeting all <h1> or <h2> elements) are unintentionally overriding the specific styles for the titles.
Updated CSS to Fix Title Visibility
Here’s a cleaned-up and corrected CSS for titles and section headers. Add this to your style.css file:

css
Copy
Edit
/* General Title Styling */
h1, h2 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* Default size for titles */
    color: #333333; /* Ensure dark gray for readability */
    margin: 20px 0; /* Add spacing around titles */
    text-align: center; /* Center titles by default */
}

/* Page Title Styling (e.g., Collaboration, Team) */
header h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* Slightly larger for page titles */
    color: #333333; /* Ensure contrast with background */
    margin: 0; /* Remove additional spacing */
    text-align: center; /* Center the page title */
}

/* Section Titles (e.g., Our Collaborators, Our Team) */
#collaborators h2, #academic-members h2 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* Standard size for section titles */
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray for visibility */
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Space below the title */
    text-align: center; /* Center section titles */
}

/* Ensure Titles Are Not Hidden */
h1, h2 {
    visibility: visible !important; /* Ensure visibility */
    display: block !important; /* Ensure block display */
}
Key Adjustments
Visibility Fix:

Added visibility: visible !important; and display: block !important; to ensure no hidden or removed styles affect titles.
Page Titles:

Customized <h1> inside <header> for larger, more prominent page titles.
Section Titles:

Added specific styles for section titles like "Our Collaborators" and "Our Team" to ensure consistency.
General Titles:

All <h1> and <h2> elements now default to a dark gray colour (#333333) and a visible font size (2rem).
Steps to Verify
Save the Updated CSS:
Save the updated style.css file with the provided fixes.

Test Across Pages:

Refresh all affected pages (e.g., Collaboration, Team, Students) in your browser.
Confirm that:
Page titles (<h1>) are visible and centered.
Section titles (<h2>) are clearly displayed.
Check for Remaining Issues:

Inspect the titles in the developer tools to confirm no unintended overrides exist.
If the issue persists, let me know, and I can help further debug the problem! 😊







You said:
titles cannot be in dark gray, since the background is in dark gray
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the background is dark gray, the titles must have a lighter contrasting colour to ensure readability. Let’s use a light cream colour (#f9f7f3) for the titles, which will contrast well against a dark gray background (#4f4f4f).

Updated CSS for Titles with Light Text
Replace or add the following styles to your style.css file:

css
Copy
Edit
/* General Title Styling */
h1, h2 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* Standard size for titles */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Light cream for contrast against dark gray background */
    margin: 20px 0; /* Add spacing around titles */
    text-align: center; /* Center titles by default */
}

/* Page Title Styling (e.g., Collaboration, Team) */
header h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* Slightly larger for page titles */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Light cream for readability */
    margin: 0; /* Remove additional spacing */
    text-align: center; /* Center the page title */
}

/* Section Titles (e.g., Our Collaborators, Our Team) */
#collaborators h2, #academic-members h2 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* Standard size for section titles */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Light cream for visibility */
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Space below the title */
    text-align: center; /* Center section titles */
}

/* Ensure Titles Are Not Hidden */
h1, h2 {
    visibility: visible !important; /* Ensure visibility */
    display: block !important; /* Ensure block display */
}
Key Changes
Light Cream Colour (#f9f7f3):

Used for all titles (h1 and h2) to provide clear contrast against the dark gray background.
Font Size:

Titles (h1) are slightly larger for prominence on the page.
Section titles (h2) remain at a standard readable size.
Spacing and Alignment:

Titles are centered and spaced consistently for a clean layout.
Forced Visibility:

Ensures no CSS rules (e.g., visibility: hidden or display: none) inadvertently hide the titles.
Steps to Verify
Save the Updated CSS:

Update your style.css file with the new styles.
Refresh the Pages:

Open all affected pages (e.g., Collaboration, Team, Students) in your browser.
Confirm the following:
Page titles (<h1>) are visible and centred.
Section titles (<h2>) contrast well against the dark gray background.
Optional Testing for Colour Contrast:

Use an online contrast checker (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker) to ensure the light cream title colour meets accessibility standards against your dark gray background.
Let me know if this resolves the issue or if further adjustments are needed! 😊

The issue lies in conflicting CSS rules that target <h1> elements globally and set their color to #333333 (dark gray). These rules override the specific styles for the <h1> in the header, causing it to blend into the dark gray background.

Key Problematic CSS Rule
This line:

css
Copy
Edit
h1, h2 {
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray headings */
}
It applies to all <h1> and <h2> elements, including the ones inside the header. This inadvertently overrides the header-specific styles, which set the <h1> color to #f9f7f3 (cream).

Solution: Scoped Styling
To fix the issue, you need to scope the global heading styles and ensure header-specific styles take precedence.

Updated CSS
Replace the problematic h1, h2 rule with this:

css
Copy
Edit
/* General Title Styling for Main Content */
main h1, main h2, #collaborators h2, #academic-members h2 {
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray headings for main sections */
}

/* Header Title Styling */
header h1 {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for contrast */
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* Slightly larger for header titles */
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px 0;
}
Why This Fix Works
Scoped Heading Styles:

The global rule now targets headings only within main and specific sections like #collaborators or #academic-members.
Header titles are excluded from this rule.
Header-Specific Rules:

The header h1 style explicitly applies to <h1> inside <header>, ensuring its color remains #f9f7f3.
Precedence:

By scoping rules and ensuring specificity, the global dark gray style no longer affects the header title.
Verification Steps
Update CSS:
Replace the conflicting rule and add the new scoped styles to your style.css.

Test in Browser:

Refresh all affected pages.
Confirm that:
Page titles (<h1> in the header) are clearly visible in cream.
Section titles (<h1>, <h2> in main) are dark gray and consistent.
Inspect Elements:
Use browser developer tools to verify that the header <h1> has the correct color: #f9f7f3.

This fix ensures a consistent and readable design across all pages. Let me know if it works! 😊

The issue persists because there are conflicting rules targeting <h1> elements in different contexts. Let's address it step by step.

Key Problematic Rules
Global h1 Color: The rule:

css
Copy
Edit
h1, h2 {
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray headings */
}
This applies to all <h1> elements, including the ones in the header. It overrides the header-specific styles.

Header-Specific Rule: The rule:

css
Copy
Edit
header h1 {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for contrast */
}
Should correctly set the color, but the global h1 style is applied last due to how CSS specificity and cascade work.

Solution: Increase Specificity for Header Titles
We need to ensure that the header h1 rule has higher specificity than the global h1 rule. Here's the updated fix:

Update CSS
css
Copy
Edit
/* General Title Styling */
main h1, main h2, #collaborators h2, #academic-members h2 {
    color: #333333; /* Dark gray headings for main sections */
}

/* Header Title Styling - Higher Specificity */
header h1 {
    color: #f9f7f3 !important; /* Force cream text for header title */
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* Slightly larger for header titles */
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px 0;
}

/* Header Navigation Styling */
header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream links for readability */
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 1rem;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream hover effect */
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/* Other Global Styles */
h1, h2 {
    color: #333333; /* Default dark gray for headings */
}
Key Changes
Force Specificity for Header Title:

The use of !important in header h1 ensures it overrides any global styles.
Scoped Heading Styles:

Limited the dark gray h1, h2 rule to content areas like main and sections (#collaborators, etc.).
Cleaned Navigation Styles:

Ensured navigation links (nav a) and header-specific elements maintain their color and visibility.
Testing Steps
Save the Updated CSS: Replace the current style.css with the updated version.

Refresh Your Pages:

Open all pages (e.g., Collaboration, Team, Students) in your browser.
Confirm the header titles are displayed in cream text (#f9f7f3).
Inspect Elements:

Use browser developer tools to ensure the header h1 is correctly styled and no conflicting rules are applied.
This fix ensures consistent title visibility without affecting other parts of the site. Let me know if this resolves the issue! 😊

You said:
The header of the main page is wider than the rest. Is this a problem of the CSS?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, this is likely due to differences in padding, margins, or the way the layout is structured in the CSS for the main page header compared to the rest of the pages.

Let’s debug and fix it step by step:

Common Causes for a Wider Header
Padding or Margin Differences:

Extra padding or margins applied to the header or its child elements (logos, title, navigation) can increase the header's width.
Container Width:

The header may have a wider container (e.g., width: 100%; or no box-sizing: border-box;).
Inconsistent Flexbox Properties:

Differences in justify-content, align-items, or flex-wrap in display: flex settings.
Default Body or HTML Margins:

The main page may have default margins or padding for the <body> or <html> tags that the other pages override.
Fixing the Issue
Normalize Header Styling Across Pages: Update the shared CSS to ensure all headers have consistent margins, padding, and layout.

Updated CSS for Header:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Normalize Header Styling */
header {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and borders in width calculation */
    width: 100%; /* Ensure full-width header */
    margin: 0; /* Remove default margins */
    padding: 0; /* Remove default padding */
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray for header background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text */
}

/* Header Content: Title and Logos */
header > div {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Logos on left and right, title in center */
    padding: 10px 20px; /* Consistent padding for all pages */
}

/* Page Title */
header h1 {
    flex-grow: 1; /* Ensure title occupies available space */
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* Larger font size for page title */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text for contrast */
    margin: 0; /* Remove any default margin */
}

/* Logos */
header img {
    height: 60px; /* Consistent logo height across pages */
    max-width: 100px; /* Limit logo width */
    vertical-align: middle;
}

/* Navigation Menu */
header nav {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #4f4f4f; /* Slightly lighter gray for menu background */
    padding: 10px 0; /* Consistent padding */
}

header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream links for readability */
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px; /* Equal spacing between links */
    font-size: 1rem; /* Consistent font size */
}

header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Soft cream hover effect */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Steps to Apply the Fix
Update the Shared CSS:

Add or replace the header-related styles in your style.css file.
Ensure All Pages Use the Same Header Structure:

Check that the HTML structure for the header is consistent across all pages. For example, all headers should follow this layout:
html
Copy
Edit
<header>
    <div>
        <div>
            <a href="index.html"><img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo"></a>
        </div>
        <h1>Page Title</h1>
        <div>
            <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="images/heriot-watt-logo.png" alt="Heriot-Watt University Logo"></a>
        </div>
    </div>
    <nav>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
        <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
        <a href="team.html">Team</a> |
        <a href="students.html">Students</a> |
        <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> |
        <a href="collaboration.html">Collaboration</a> |
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
Test in Browser:

Open the main page and compare its header with other pages. Confirm that all headers have the same width and alignment.
Inspect and Debug:

Use browser developer tools to inspect the header’s box-sizing, padding, margin, and width properties. Adjust any inconsistencies.
Outcome
After applying the updated CSS, all headers should have:

The same width.
Consistent spacing for logos, titles, and navigation menus.
Uniform height and padding.

The CSS you provided already includes consistent styling for headers. However, if the header on the main page appears wider, the issue might be related to additional padding or margin differences in the <header> element on that page specifically, or differences in the HTML structure of the header.

Here’s how to debug and fix the issue:

Key Areas to Check
Check HTML Structure for the Main Page Header:

Ensure the <header> structure is consistent with other pages.
If there’s any extra padding, margin, or a larger h1, this might cause the width discrepancy.
Example (standardized header structure):

html
Copy
Edit
<header>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; padding: 10px 20px;">
        <!-- Left: ML-Health Group Logo -->
        <div>
            <a href="index.html">
                <img src="images/ml-health-logo.png" alt="ML-Health Logo" style="height: 60px;">
            </a>
        </div>

        <!-- Center: Page Title -->
        <h1 style="flex-grow: 1; text-align: center; margin: 0; font-size: 2.5rem; color: #f9f7f3;">Page Title</h1>

        <!-- Right: Heriot-Watt University Logo -->
        <div>
            <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/heriot-watt-logo.png" alt="Heriot-Watt University Logo" style="height: 60px;">
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Navigation Menu -->
    <nav style="background-color: #4f4f4f; padding: 10px 0; text-align: center;">
        <a href="index.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Home</a> |
        <a href="projects.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Projects</a> |
        <a href="team.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Team</a> |
        <a href="students.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Students</a> |
        <a href="publications.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Publications</a> |
        <a href="collaboration.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Collaboration</a> |
        <a href="contact.html" style="color: #f9f7f3; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 15px;">Contact</a>
    </nav>
</header>
CSS Padding and Margin Consistency: Ensure all <header> elements have consistent padding and margins. Update the header styling in your CSS if necessary:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Normalize Header Styling */
header {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and borders in width */
    width: 100%; /* Ensure the header spans the full width */
    margin: 0; /* Remove any default margins */
    padding: 0; /* Remove any default padding */
    background-color: #333333; /* Dark gray background */
    color: #f9f7f3; /* Cream text */
}

/* Header Content */
header > div {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 10px 20px; /* Consistent padding for all headers */
}

/* Header Navigation */
header nav {
    background-color: #4f4f4f;
    padding: 10px 0;
    text-align: center;
}

header nav a {
    color: #f9f7f3;
    text-decoration: none;
    margin: 0 15px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

header nav a:hover {
    color: #e0d6b9; /* Light cream on hover */
    text-decoration: underline;
}
Debugging Steps
Compare HTML Headers:

Compare the <header> structure in the main page HTML with other pages.
Check for differences in padding, margins, or extra elements that might cause the main page header to appear wider.
Inspect CSS in Browser:

Open the browser developer tools and inspect the <header> on the main page.
Look for differences in applied styles (e.g., padding, margins, or width).
Test Changes:

Apply the updated header HTML and CSS to the main page.
Reload the page and verify the header width matches other pages.
Expected Outcome
The main page header should align perfectly with the headers on other pages.
Logos, titles, and navigation will have consistent spacing and alignment across the site.
If the issue persists, feel free to share the specific differences observed in the browser developer tools! 😊

can you give me only what I need to change in the current CSS?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s the minimal set of changes you need to make in your current CSS to ensure the header width and layout are consistent across all pages:

Changes in Your Current CSS
Update header Styling: Add the following to normalize the header's box-sizing and spacing:

css
Copy
Edit
header {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensure padding and borders are included in width */
    width: 100%; /* Make sure the header spans the full page width */
    margin: 0; /* Remove any default margins */
    padding: 0; /* Remove extra padding */
}
Adjust header > div Styling: Add consistent padding for the container holding the logos and title:

css
Copy
Edit
header > div {
    padding: 10px 20px; /* Consistent padding for all pages */
}
Ensure Consistent Navigation Bar Padding: Update the header nav styles for consistent spacing:

css
Copy
Edit
header nav {
    padding: 10px 0; /* Consistent padding for the navigation bar */
}
Optional: Logo Alignment
If logo sizes vary across pages, you can normalize them:

css
Copy
Edit
header img {
    height: 60px; /* Uniform logo height across all pages */
    vertical-align: middle; /* Align logos with the text */
}
Implementation Steps
Locate the header section in your CSS and apply the above updates.
Save the file and refresh your pages.
Verify the header’s width and layout are consistent across all pages.
These changes should resolve the issue without affecting other elements. Let me know if you need further assistance! 😊

You said:
how can I update the image in github?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To update the banner image on your GitHub repository and make it reflect on your website, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Image
Ensure the new banner image is saved on your computer with the correct dimensions and format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
Rename the image file appropriately (e.g., ml-health-banner.png) if needed.
2. Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub
Go to your repository (e.g., https://github.com/MartaVallejo/ML-Health).
Open the images folder (or the folder where the current banner is stored).
3. Upload the New Image
Click the "Add file" dropdown at the top right.
Select "Upload files."
Drag and drop your new image into the upload box.
If the image name is the same as the current one (ml-health-banner.png), it will overwrite the old file. If not, you can rename it during the upload.
Write a commit message like "Updated the website banner" in the "Commit changes" box.
Click "Commit changes."
4. Update the Image Reference in Your Code (if needed)
If the new image has a different name or location, update the HTML file to point to the new image:

Open the HTML file where the banner is referenced (index.html).
Update the <img> tag to match the new image path:
html
Copy
Edit
<img src="images/ml-health-banner.png" alt="ML-Health Research Group Banner" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
5. Verify the Update
Open your website (https://martavallejo.github.io/ML-Health) to confirm the new banner is displayed.
If the old image still appears, clear your browser cache or refresh using Ctrl + F5.
Let me know if you encounter any issues!

To make the logos cover the full height of the dark gray section while keeping them proportional, update your header styling like this:

Changes to Apply:
Increase the height of the logos to make them fill the dark gray background.
Ensure vertical alignment by using align-items: stretch; in the #welcome-section container.
Maintain proportions using object-fit: contain;.

What This Fixes:
✅ Logos will scale dynamically to cover the full height of the dark gray background.
✅ Title remains centered without affecting layout.
✅ Logos won't distort—they will resize while keeping proportions.

Changes & Features:
✅ Uses the same "card" layout as the Team page (profile photo on left, details on right).
✅ Includes supervisor information.
✅ Has a separate "Alumni" section for past students.
✅ Clickable links open research profiles in a new tab.

Next Steps:
Upload student photos to the images/ folder in GitHub.
Ensure correct supervisor names and research profile links are updated.
This will make the Students page visually cohesive with the Team page while presenting the information clearly and professionally. 🚀

you didn't use the information on the page I gave you, but what you have in your memory, and I lost the updated work. How can I access GitHub to the previous version?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You can restore a previous version of your students.html file on GitHub by following these steps:

Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface
Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/martavallejo/ML-Health).
Click on the file you want to restore (students.html).
Click on "History" (Clock Icon) at the top right of the file.
Find the previous version in the commit history.
Click on the commit before the unwanted change.
Click “Browse Files” or view the file at that state.
Copy the previous version of the code.
Edit the current students.html file, paste the previous version, and commit the change.
Option 2: Using Git on Your Computer
If you have the repository cloned locally, you can use the command line to revert:

Open Terminal or Git Bash.
Navigate to your project folder:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd path/to/your/repository
Check the commit history for students.html:
bash
Copy
Edit
git log -- students.html
Look for a commit before the unwanted changes.
Copy the commit hash (a long alphanumeric string).
Restore the previous version:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- students.html
Commit the change:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add students.html
git commit -m "Restored previous version of students.html"
git push origin main
Option 3: Restore from GitHub Desktop
Open GitHub Desktop.
Navigate to your repository.
Click on "History".
Find the commit before the unwanted change.
Right-click the commit → Click "Revert this commit".
Once you've restored the previous version, you can send me the correct content, and I'll properly format it without losing any updates. 🚀

        </div>" I want the name of the student to appear side to side with the dates of their PhD. currently, the dates are shown in a new line. Can you fix it?
ChatGPT said:

To ensure that the PhD dates appear on the same line as the student's name, you can modify the h3 tag by using inline styling or CSS flexbox.

    </div>
</div>
Alternative (CSS-based solution)
Instead of inline styles, you can define a CSS rule in your style.css file:

1️⃣ Add this to style.css
css
Copy
Edit
.member-details h3 {
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 10px; /* Adjust spacing */
}

.member-details span {
    font-size: 1rem;
    color: #666; /* Adjust text color */
}
2️⃣ Update your HTML

<div class="member-box">

✅ Effect
The name and dates now appear on the same line.
The dates are in a smaller, subtle font for readability.
Works consistently across all students.
Let me know if you need further refinements! 🚀

Your current CSS should work, but the issue might be that h3 is a block element by default, which forces the PhD dates onto a new line. Try these fixes:

Solution 1: Use display: inline; on h3 and span
Modify this section in your CSS file:

css
Copy
Edit
.member-details h3 {
    display: inline; /* Ensures the name and dates appear on the same line */
    margin-right: 10px; /* Adjust spacing */
}

.member-details span {
    display: inline; /* Ensures dates stay on the same line */
    font-size: 1rem;
    color: #666; /* Adjust text color */
}
Solution 2: Use a div container with display: flex;
If the first solution doesn't work, try wrapping the h3 and the span inside a <div> with CSS flexbox.

Modify your HTML like this:
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="member-box">
    <img src="images/EdRees.jpg" alt="Ed Rees" class="profile-photo"> 
    <div class="member-details">
        <div class="student-title">
            <h3>Ed Rees</h3><span>(2023-2027)</span>
        </div>
        <p>Research: Mimicking the protective, tactile, and interface capabilities of human skin for soft robotics.</p>
        <p>Supervisor: <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-crichton">Dr Michael Crichton</a>
        Co-supervisor: <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/marta-vallejo">Dr Marta Vallejo</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
Then add this to your CSS:
css
Copy
Edit
.student-title {
    display: flex; /* Makes name and dates stay side by side */
    align-items: center; /* Aligns text vertically */
    gap: 10px; /* Adds spacing between name and dates */
}

.student-title h3 {
    margin: 0; /* Remove default margins */
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}

.student-title span {
    font-size: 1rem;
    color: #666;
}
✅ Expected Effect
The name and PhD dates will appear on the same line.
The dates will be slightly smaller and grey for clarity.
Works for all students consistently.
Try this out and let me know if you need any further adjustments! 🚀

ChatGPT said:

You can modify the HTML structure to include a line for the current position of the alumni. Here's how you can do it:

Updated HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<div class="member-box">
    <img src="images/DorianGouzou.jpg" alt="Dorian Gouzou" class="profile-photo">
    <div class="member-details">
        <h3>Dorian Gouzou</h3>
        <p>Thesis on deep learning for fluorescence lifetime and retinal imaging.</p>
        <p><strong>Completed:</strong> 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Current Position:</strong> Research Scientist at Optos, Scotland</p>
        <p><a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/dorian-gouzou" target="_blank">Research Profile</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
CSS (if you want to style the new entry)
If you'd like to style the "Current Position" line slightly differently (maybe bold or colored), add this to your CSS:

css
Copy
Edit
.member-details p strong {
    color: #444; /* Darker text for emphasis */
    font-weight: bold;
}
What This Does:
Adds a "Current Position" line below the completion year.
Ensures consistent formatting for all alumni.
Makes it clear where former students are working now.
Let me know if you need any refinements! 🚀

Yes, it's definitely possible to create two columns to separate the academics based in Edinburgh and Dubai. Below is the updated HTML structure that organizes them into two distinct columns.

CSS for Two Columns Layout:
Add this to your CSS file to style the columns properly:

css
Copy
Edit
.academic-columns {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    gap: 20px;
}

.academic-column {
    width: 48%; /* Ensures both columns take equal space */
}

.academic-column h3 {
    text-align: center;
    color: #333;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Responsive Design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .academic-columns {
        flex-direction: column; /* Stack columns on smaller screens */
    }

    .academic-column {
        width: 100%; /* Full width on smaller screens */
    }
}
Changes & Features:
✅ Two-column layout: One for Edinburgh and another for Dubai.
✅ Maintains responsive design: On smaller screens, the columns stack vertically.
✅ Consistent styling: Uses member-box structure while keeping it clean and readable.

Now, your Team page will clearly distinguish between academic members in Edinburgh and Dubai in a structured and professional manner. 🚀 Let me know if you need any adjustments!

It looks like the issue is likely due to the academic-columns container not being styled correctly or the display: flex not applying properly. Let's ensure the CSS is correctly applied and force the columns to appear side by side.

.academic-column {

Key Fixes
✅ Enforced flexbox behavior → display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between;
✅ Added a shadow & background to sections → Helps visually distinguish the columns.
✅ Ensured columns align side-by-side on larger screens but stack on mobile for better responsiveness.

Expected Result
The "Edinburgh" academics appear in one column.
The "Dubai" academics appear in another column.
Proper spacing & styling makes it look cleaner and more professional.
Fully responsive for mobile and larger screens.
Now your academic members page will show two distinct sections with clear visual separation. 🎯 Let me know if you'd like any further tweaks! 🚀

I have reviewed your CSS file and found the main issues that are likely preventing the two-column layout from displaying correctly. Below are the issues and fixes:

Identified Issues:
Duplicate width property for .academic-column

There are two .academic-column definitions with different properties, which might be causing conflicts.
The first one only sets the width, while the second one includes background color, padding, and box-shadow.
flex-wrap: wrap; is missing in .academic-columns

Without flex-wrap, the columns will not adjust properly in smaller screens.
align-items: flex-start; is missing in .academic-columns

Ensures content inside each column aligns at the top instead of stretching unevenly.
Profile photo flex: 0 0 100px; may cause alignment issues

It's better to allow flexibility with min-width: 100px; and max-width: 120px;.
Fixed & Optimized CSS
Use this updated version in your CSS file:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Academic Members Section */
.academic-columns {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Ensures proper wrapping for smaller screens */
    justify-content: space-between;
    gap: 20px;
    align-items: flex-start; /* Aligns content at the top */
}

.academic-column {
    width: 48%; /* Each column takes half of the space */
    background-color: #ffffff; /* Adds distinction between columns */
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    min-height: 100%; /* Makes sure both columns are equal in height */
}

/* Align column titles */
.academic-column h3 {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    color: #333;
    background-color: #f9f7f3; /* Soft cream background */
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

/* Adjust styling for the member boxes */
.member-box {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    background: #ffffff;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    transition: transform 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;
}

.member-box:hover {
    transform: scale(1.02);
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

/* Profile Photo */
.profile-photo {
    min-width: 100px;
    max-width: 120px;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 50%;
    margin-right: 15px;
}

/* Responsive Design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .academic-columns {
        flex-direction: column; /* Stack columns on smaller screens */
        gap: 10px;
    }

    .academic-column {
        width: 100%; /* Make full-width for smaller screens */
    }
}

Summary of Fixes
✅ Fixed the .academic-column width duplication issue
✅ Added flex-wrap: wrap; to ensure proper column layout
✅ Ensured align-items: flex-start; for better vertical alignment
✅ Adjusted .profile-photo size for better alignment
✅ Made it fully responsive for mobile and tablet views

Expected Outcome
✔️ Two equal columns side-by-side (Edinburgh & Dubai).
✔️ Consistent spacing & styling between team members.
✔️ Looks great on desktop & mobile (columns will stack on smaller screens).

Next Steps
Replace the old CSS with the fixed version above.
Ensure the updated HTML structure is correctly used in your team.html.
Test the layout on both desktop and mobile.
🚀 Now it should work exactly as expected! Let me know if you need more adjustments. 🎯
