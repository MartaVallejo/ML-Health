                    <p>
                        We are delighted to announce that our paper, 
                        <em>Self-Supervised Learning for Pre-training Capsule Networks: Overcoming Medical Imaging Dataset Challenges</em>, 
                        led by <strong>Ms Heba Elshimy</strong>, has been awarded the Best Paper Award at 
                        <a href="https://isdia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            ISDIA 2025
                        </a>, held at the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) on January 3-4, 2025.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning in medical imaging faces a critical challenge: the scarcity of large, high-quality annotated datasets. 
                        While pre-training on extensive datasets is a common solution, it demands substantial computational resources that aren't always available to researchers. 
                        Our work demonstrates how to overcome these limitations by improving Capsule Networks (CapsNet)‚Äîan innovative but under-utilised architecture‚Äîfor polyp classification 
                        using limited, imbalanced data.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        We developed a novel approach using self-supervised learning (SSL), where CapsNet creates its own training signals through tasks like image colourisation, contrastive learning, and in-painting. 
                        This method achieved improved performance on downstream tasks, increasing the classification accuracy by 5.26% compared to other weight initialisation methods. 
                        This work opens new paths for deep learning in the medical imaging field, particularly when working with challenging datasets.
                    </p>

                    <p>The ML-Health Research Group proudly supported the <strong>Women@CS Hackathon</strong>, a <strong>24-hour event</strong> held on <strong>8th-9th February</strong> at 
                        <a href="https://thenationalrobotarium.com/" target="_blank">Heriot-Watt University‚Äôs National Robotarium</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Women@CS hosted this dynamic 24-hour hackathon, offering students an exciting opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and tackle real-world sustainability challenges aligned with Diageo‚Äôs Spirit of Progress 2030 initiative.
                        
                        Generously <strong>sponsored by Diageo</strong>, the event challenged participants to analyse a dataset inspired by real production and environmental metrics. Teams explored how energy is sourced and consumed across distilleries, brewing facilities, and offices worldwide. Working through the night, they developed data-driven solutions to enhance energy efficiency and integrate renewable sources, driving impactful change.
