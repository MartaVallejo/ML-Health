                            ISDIA 2025
                        </a>, held at the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) on January 3-4, 2025.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning in medical imaging faces a critical challenge: the scarcity of large, high-quality annotated datasets. 
                        While pre-training on extensive datasets is a common solution, it demands substantial computational resources that aren't always available to researchers. 
                        Our work demonstrates how to overcome these limitations by improving Capsule Networks (CapsNet)‚Äîan innovative but under-utilised architecture‚Äîfor polyp classification 
                        using limited, imbalanced data.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        We developed a novel approach using self-supervised learning (SSL), where CapsNet creates its own training signals through tasks like image colourisation, contrastive learning, and in-painting. 
                        This method achieved improved performance on downstream tasks, increasing the classification accuracy by 5.26% compared to other weight initialisation methods. 
                        This work opens new paths for deep learning in the medical imaging field, particularly when working with challenging datasets.
